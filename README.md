# Daily Task Planner - Team Hawk

This system was developed to address the need for task management, enabling users to organize their day-to-day responsibilities effectively. It helps users keep track of their pending tasks, monitor progress by marking tasks as completed, and manage their tasks by adding, deleting, and searching for specific tasks. In addition, the system is built to work as a simple, yet powerful tool to assist in time management and productivity improvement.

## Technologies Used:

- **C**: The main programming language used for developing the core functionality of the task planner. C was chosen for its efficiency, performance, and low-level control over system resources.
- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection): Used to compile and build the C program. It's a widely-used tool for compiling C and C++ code on various platforms.
- **Standard Libraries**:
  - **stdio.h**: Provides functions for input and output operations.
  - **stdlib.h**: Used for memory allocation and process control.
  - **string.h**: Provides functions for string manipulation, such as comparing, copying, and concatenating strings.
  - **time.h**: For handling date and time operations, useful for timestamping tasks or managing due dates.




## Local Setup

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3. **Install a C compiler:**
    - Make sure you have a C compiler installed. You can use **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) for Linux or **MinGW** for Windows.
    - For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), you can install GCC by running:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install build-essential
      ```

4. **Compile the code:**
    - Once the compiler is set up, compile the C code with:
      ```bash
      gcc project.c -o daily_task_planner
      ```

5. **Run the application:**
    - After compiling, execute the program using:
      ```bash
      ./daily_task_planner
      ```

6. **Optional (for Windows):**
    - If you're on Windows, you may need to use MinGW or another C compiler to compile and run the code.

7. **Usage:**
    - Once the application is running, follow the on-screen instructions to manage your daily tasks, including adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.

Ensure that you replace `your-username/your-repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
