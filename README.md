# Daily Task Planner - Team Hawk

This system was developed to address the need for task management, enabling users to organize their day-to-day responsibilities effectively. It helps users keep track of their pending tasks, monitor progress by marking tasks as completed, and manage their tasks by adding, deleting, and searching for specific tasks. In addition, the system is built to work as a simple, yet powerful tool to assist in time management and productivity improvement.
